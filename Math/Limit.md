> limits are values that you can infinitely get closer and closer but never get to them because they "don't exist". They like a hole in the bride  you can get closer to the edge but, you can't stand in the middle.

## example 
$$
f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x-1}
$$
*This function is correct for all number besides `1` because it equals to  `0` which is  {**undefined**} .*
$$
f(1) = \frac{1-1}{1-1}= \frac{0}{0} 
$$
That means `1` and output is `undefined` and  `0.999999` is valid number but  you newer can get to `1`

The **limit** of $$\frac{x2âˆ’1}{xâˆ’1}$$                                                                                                                      as x approaches 1 is **2**
